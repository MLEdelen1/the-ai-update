# The AI Update — Daily 4:00 AM Checklist

At 4:00 AM every day, run this checklist in order.

## 1) Source Freshness Scan
Run a full source scan and confirm newest items are captured, especially YouTube channels and high-signal AI sources.
If any source feed is stale or failing, note it and apply fallback collection immediately.

## 2) New Update Triage
Score new items by practical impact, novelty, and actionability.
Discard low-signal noise and prioritize items regular users and small businesses can apply.

## 3) Transcript-First Processing
For any selected video source, pull and read full transcript before writing.
If one source contains multiple major updates, split into multiple article drafts.

## 4) Article Production
Publish source-grounded articles with clear sections for what changed, why it matters, and what to do next.
No placeholders, no shallow summaries, no generic filler.

## 5) Quality Gate
Verify each article has a valid original source link and meaningful substance.
Check for garbled text, formatting drift, and layout consistency before publish.

## 6) Website Freshness + Cache Bust Check
Confirm the newest articles are visible on the Articles page.
If stale content is visible, increment cache-bust versioning and republish.

## 7) Distribution Pass
Prepare and queue social-ready summaries for X posting.
Prioritize high-signal hooks tied to freshly published articles.

## 8) Business KPI Snapshot
Capture quick daily metrics: new articles published, source count reviewed, freshness latency, and top-performing post/link.
Note blockers and action items for same-day correction.

## 9) End-of-Run Output
Post a concise daily summary:
What was published, what sources were used, what was fixed, and what still needs action.

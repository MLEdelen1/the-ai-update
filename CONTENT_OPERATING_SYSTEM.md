# Content Operating System (Skill-Driven)

## Purpose
This document turns The AI Update publishing process into a repeatable system using the newly installed skills and existing pipeline.

## Stage 1: Discovery
Use `technews`, `daily-ai-news-skill`, and YouTube-focused inputs (`youtube-api`, `captions`, `subtitles`, `tube-summary`) to pull raw candidates.
Filter for practical impact, not just headline novelty.

## Stage 2: Verification
For every selected source, read full source text.
For videos, require full transcript ingestion before drafting.
Capture evidence points and links before writing starts.

## Stage 3: Structuring
Use `content-strategy` and `newsletter-creation-curation` patterns to map each story into one of three outputs: short update, long-form breakdown, or implementation guide.
If one source has multiple major updates, split into multiple articles.

## Stage 4: Drafting Standards
Every article must include clear sections for what changed, why it matters, and what to do next.
No generic placeholder language.
No source-free claims.
Keep wording beginner-friendly but operationally useful.

## Stage 5: Business Conversion Layer
Every article should include one CTA aligned to business objective: toolkit signup, newsletter subscription, or premium waitlist.
Rotate CTA focus weekly based on KPI targets.

## Stage 6: Distribution
Primary publish target is website.
Secondary amplification on X using article hooks and concise insight posts.
Use `x-articles` patterns for stronger social packaging when relevant.

## Stage 7: Weekly Review
Review top articles by traffic, click-through, and conversion.
Identify which source categories drive best business outcomes.
Update next week’s topic priority list accordingly.

## Near-Term Implementation
Build a lightweight scoring sheet for candidate stories using impact, novelty, actionability, and audience fit.
Add one “implementation matrix” component to each major article.
Create weekly newsletter from top 5 scored updates plus one deep-dive.

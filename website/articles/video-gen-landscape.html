Start with short clips and one clear scene goal. Trying to generate a full polished ad in one pass usually wastes time.</p><h2>What matters most in early results</h2><p>Motion consistency, subject stability, and camera control matter more than pure resolution. A lower-resolution clip with coherent movement is more useful than a high-resolution clip with drifting faces and inconsistent objects. Start with short duration and iterate story beats before scaling up.</p><h2>Beginner workflow that reduces failures</h2><p>Write a one-sentence scene intent, then a shot description, then movement notes. Generate two or three variants, choose the strongest, then refine only one variable like camera motion or lighting. Keep notes on what changed. This turns video generation into a learnable process instead of random retries.</p><h2>Where people lose money</h2><p>They over-generate. Create fewer drafts with tighter prompts and stronger selection rules. Plan shot lists first, then generate only the shots you need. If the clip quality is unstable, switch to a hybrid workflow where AI generates drafts and a normal editor handles final timing and cuts.</p><h2>Practical next step</h2><p>Use AI video for one repeatable use case this week, such as intro clips, short explainers, or ad variations. Do not expand until that one use case is stable.</p><p><a class="btn-main" href="../tools.html">Open Tools</a></p></main><footer><div class="contain foot-inner"><div class="foot-brand"><img src="../assets/logo.png" class="foot-logo" alt=""><span>THE AI UPDATE</span></div></div></footer><script src="../site.js"></script></body></html>

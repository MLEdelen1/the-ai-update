# 🛡️ Intelligence Brief #001: The Death of the $20 AI Subscription

In this issue, we break down why paying for multiple AI tools is becoming a legacy behavior. 

### ⚡ The Core Shift
With the release of DeepSeek V3 and the expansion of Google's NotebookLM, the "Translation Layer" is becoming free. 

### 🔧 Actionable Steps for Businesses
1. Replace your internal research subscriptions with custom NotebookLM notebooks.
2. Move high-volume coding tasks to DeepSeek's API (90% cheaper than competitors).

### 🔮 Trend Prediction
Expect a "Subscription Consolidation" in Q3 2026. Only the models with the best *user experience* (not just intelligence) will survive.

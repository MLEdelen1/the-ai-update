# System Prompts And Models Of AI Tools

## What Is The "System Prompts And Models Of AI Tools" Repository?

Imagine you want to bake the perfect cake. Most AI tools just give you the finished cake. But this special collection, found on GitHub, is like finding a secret recipe book from the world's best bakers. It’s called "System Prompts And Models Of AI Tools."

This collection shows you the hidden instructions (we call them "system prompts") that top AI tools like Perplexity and Devin AI use. It also lists the special equipment (internal tools) they have and even the type of flour (AI models like GPT-4) they prefer. It’s not an AI program you can run. Instead, it’s a powerful resource explaining *how* many great AI dishes are made.

## How It Works (Under the Hood)

This repository doesn't have an "engine" or "brains" like a true AI model. Think of it as a digital library, filled with important notes.

Inside, you'll find simple text files and code snippets. These files hold key information:

*   **System Prompts:** These are the precise instructions given to an AI. They guide the AI to act in a certain way, like telling a chef exactly how to prepare a dish.
*   **Tool Descriptions:** These explain the internal software tools that AI programs use to get their job done.
*   **AI Models:** The files also name the specific AI "brains" (like GPT-4 or Claude 3) that are reportedly powering these different tools.

It’s all about understanding the behind-the-scenes commands that make popular AI tools behave the way they do.

## Speed & Cost (Benchmark Table)

This repository is a collection of information, not an active AI tool or program. Because of this, it doesn't have typical performance benchmarks like how fast it runs or how much it costs to operate. Those kinds of numbers apply to the actual AI models *referenced within* the collection, not the collection itself.

Here’s how to think about it:

| Metric        | Value | Explanation                                                                                                 |
| :------------ | :---- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance** | N/A   | This repository is a collection of text files. It does not perform computations or generate AI output itself. |
| **Speed**     | N/A   | There is no "processing speed" for looking at these documents. Your download speed applies.                   |
| **Cost**      | N/A   | Accessing this public GitHub repository is free. There is no direct cost to "run" this information resource. |

## Business & Career Impact

This repository offers huge value if you work with AI. It's like getting a cheat sheet for AI development:

*   **For AI Developers & Prompt Engineers:** You can see exactly how successful AI tools are built and guided. This treasure trove of examples can save "hundreds of hours in R&D" by showing you what works. It's like learning from the best.
*   **For Researchers & Competitors:** You gain insight into "how established AI tools are built and guided." This helps you understand what makes them successful and improve your own products.
*   **Specific Advantage:** By using these insights, you can speed up your own product development by "20-40%" because you'll make better design choices from the start. This means getting to market faster.

## How to Make Money With This

This repository holds secrets you can turn into cash. Here are specific steps:

1.  **Become an Expert Analyst:** Dive deep into the various system prompts and AI model references in the repository. Look for common patterns and advanced tricks used for different tasks, like generating code or summarizing text. Become the go-to person who understands *why* certain AI tools work so well.
2.  **Create "Behind-the-Scenes" Content:** Use your new expertise to make blog posts, YouTube videos, or online courses. Show people how tools like Perplexity AI likely use their system prompts for smart searches. Explain the likely secrets behind Devin AI's code-making strategy. People pay for knowledge that simplifies complex tech.
3.  **Offer Prompt Engineering Consulting:** Market yourself to startups and businesses as a prompt engineering consultant. Use the repository's successful examples to design and improve the system prompts for their custom AI tools. You can charge "hourly rates (e.g., $75-$250/hour)" or set project fees. This helps clients get better results from their AI much faster.

## What It Can't Do

While super helpful, this repository has its limits:

*   **Not Always Perfect:** The information "may not always be perfectly accurate or up-to-date." AI tools change very quickly. Some entries might be guesses.
*   **Not a "Magic Button":** This is a collection of information, not a ready-to-use AI tool. You still need to understand, change, and apply what you learn to your own projects.
*   **Not the Whole Story:** Companies protect their secrets. This repository won't have *all* the internal workings of any listed AI tool, only what's publicly known or guessed.
*   **Handle With Care:** Some information here could be sensitive competitive data. Use it responsibly and ethically.

## The Verdict

This repository is an invaluable map for navigating the complex world of AI design and development.

    "executive_summary": "Uber's development of a digital twin for Dara Khosrowshahi marks a significant shift from generic productivity AI to specialized **Corporate Persona Agents**. Architecturally, this likely involves a base model (such as GPT-4o or an internal Llama-3 derivative) fine-tuned on the CEO’s public earnings calls, interviews, and internal memos. By utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the bot doesn't just mimic his voice; it references specific Uber metrics and strategic pillars to provide contextually accurate feedback.<br><br>From a technical standpoint, the 'velocity gain' Dara mentions stems from reducing the 'feedback latency' for engineers. Instead of waiting for a quarterly review or a 15-minute sync, teams can iterate hourly against a simulated executive gatekeeper. This project highlights the ROI of **Internal LLM Utility**: by lowering the friction of alignment, Uber effectively increases its operational bandwidth without adding headcount. For the 'Curious Developer,' this is a blueprint for the next wave of B2B SaaS—customized executive agents that act as a bridge between high-level strategy and ground-level execution."

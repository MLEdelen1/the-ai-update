# 🎙️ The AI Update: Brand Voice & Style Guide

## 1. Core Identity
We are the "Translation Layer" for AI. We take complex, expensive, or hype-filled news and translate it into practical ROI for businesses and actionable steps for regular people.

## 2. Tone & Diction
- **Accessible, not academic:** No jargon without a 5-word explanation.
- **Optimistic, not utopian:** Acknowledge risks, but focus on utility.
- **Confident, not arrogant:** Use phrases like "Here's how to..." and "The reality is..."
- **Concise:** Every word must earn its place. No "fluff" phrases like "In the ever-evolving landscape of AI."

## 3. Engagement Rules
- Use emojis as structural anchors (e.g., 🚨 for news, 💡 for insights, 🔧 for tools).
- Lead with the **value**, not the name of the company.
- Always answer the question: "Why should I care if I don't have a $10,000 GPU?"

## 4. Formatting
- X Threads: Hook -> Context -> Problem -> Solution -> Action -> CTA.
- Single Tweets: [Hook] + [Insight] + [Link].
